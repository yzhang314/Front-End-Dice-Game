\
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds\
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score\
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn\
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn\
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game\

CHALLENGING GAME RULES\
Change the game to follow these rules:\
\
1. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100. (Hint: you can read that value with the .value property in JavaScript. This is a good oportunity to use google to figure this out :)\
2. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)\
